# AnInquiryforKings
Text based trivia game based on Monty Python and the Holy Grail

So this Trivia game is based on a few known quotes from the movie referenced here. Currently it is case sensitive and has a few broken peices of code including during its creation for-loops did not recognize "i" as an index and you'll read in the code a let "i" variable was declared which should be redundant for someone else's IDE. Also it utilizes the old HTML prompt.

Be sure to download the HTML, CSS, and JS files for it to fully make sense.

There is some redundancy due to school assingment parameters as this code was Originally written for a class but its sufficient enough fun to send to the world. So 'hello world' as you speak for the King.
